### Summary

Task 4 in Andy Sterkowitz' Software Development Mastermind program involved creating a simple Javascript/HTML/CSS Rock Paper Scissor Game. The user is able to click 3 icons to specify their choice. Upon clicking their choice, the CPU will randomly choose one of their own, compare the results, a winner will be determined, and the score will be updated. This exercise is designed to demonstrate DOM manipulation, event listeners, and writing functional Javascript.
